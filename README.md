# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This webpage was created in order to help coding bootcamp students like myself study and retain skills learned throughout the course of this bootcamp. This website will grow and develop, much like myself and my classmates, through the duration of this course and beyond. By having the opportunity to update this website with new knowledge gained from daily learning I was able to apply the skills gained in HTML, CSS, Git, and Js and review them in a structured, organized way.
